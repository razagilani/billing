To enable bill image rendering in development environment:

1. Make sure the following system packages are installed:
    imagemagick
    poppler-utils
    libz a.k.a. zlib

2. Make sure libz is installed in the place where PIL is expecting it during
compilation:
    sudo ln -s /usr/lib/x86_64-linux-gnu/libz.so /usr/lib/libz.so
"x86_64-linux-gnu" varies between machines so you may need to replace it with
something else (ls /usr/lib to find out what).

3. Make sure the following Python packages are installed in your ReeBill
virtualenv:
    reportlab
    ChartDirector (needs to be installed via non-standard hack)
    PIL (used by reportlab, but not installed when you pip install reportlab)

TODO: merge this into any development-environment setup documentation that may
exist.
