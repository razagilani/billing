stopped here - figure out how to get rate_structure_items into a class so that programmatic behavior may be applied
to the values that yaml loads. E.g. binding to the bill RSIDescriptor, BLOCK_ONE

rate_structure_items:
- descriptor: BLOCK_ONE
  description: First block gas
  quantity: REG_TOTAL_CCF
  rate: 25.00
