#Create Extractor
A user interface for creating new extractors for Uility Bill PDFs.
Each extractor is specific to a bill format, so if a utility changes its format or we start getting bills from a new utility, a new extractor will have to be created. 

## Install:
Run <pre>npm install</pre> in this directory to setup angular and its dependencies.

_** Note: ** Currently create-extractor is not part of the file structure of the rest of the billentry app, since it's still being tested, and I'm not sure how to integrate it, 
since create-extractor uses angular and billentry is in ext.js._
